        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Eggplant – you can use any type of eggplant you have, European or Asian; both will work excellently with
                this recipe.</li>
            <li>Parsley – fresh parsley, if possible</li>
            <li>Salt & pepper – just use your favorite brand.</li>
            <li>Parmigiano Reggiano – freshly grated, if possible,</li>
            <li>Breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>Egg – beaten.</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil – if you prefer, you can use a bit of olive oil for roasting the eggplant; but it needs to
                be vegetable oil for frying.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by preheating the oven to 225°C (400°F).</li>
            <li>Pour oil on the eggplants and place them on a baking tray (photo 1).</li>
            <li>Once the oven is ready, place the baking tray inside for twenty-five to thirty minutes or until the
                eggplants have softened; then set them aside until they’re cool enough to handle.</li>
            <li>Scoop the eggplants’ insides with a spoon and place them on a strainer to drain (photo 2).</li>
            <li>Once the eggplants have been drained, place them in a medium bowl and add the parsley, cheese, half a
                cup of breadcrumbs, salt, pepper, and egg (photo 3).</li>
            <li>Mix with a fork to combine the mixture evenly (photo 4).</li>
            <li>Use a tablespoon to take a portion of the mixture and form it into a ball.</li>
            <li>Roll each ball in the remaining breadcrumbs (photo 5).</li>
            <li>Using a medium-sized saucepan, heat vegetable oil.</li>
            <li>Once the oil is ready, start cooking the eggplant meatballs (photo 6).</li>
            <li>Once the balls turned brown on all sides, take them out of the pan (photo 7).</li>
            <li>Place them on top of a kitchen paper to remove excess oil (photo 8).</li>
        </ol>
